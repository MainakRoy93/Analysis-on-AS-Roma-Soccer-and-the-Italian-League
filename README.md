# Analysis-on-AS-Roma-Soccer-and-the-Italian-League
This repository consists of documentation and R code, that analsyses how AS Roma can win more matches in their league using Association Rules Mining

## Task
How can we increase AS Roma’s chances of securing a top 4 placement in the league? We aim to assist AS Roma to consistently place higher in the league after implementing our recommendations.

## Background
AS Roma can leverage hidden trends in football match data to gain an edge in tight matches. A slight advantage can make the difference between a win or a loss for the team, and can ultimately be the difference between whether or not AS Roma participates in the championship. These advantages become especially pertinent when AS Roma is on the cusp of finishing in the top four and securing a slot in the championships. In order to launch itself over this key barrier, AS Roma must deploy the best mix of players, emphasize training for skills associated with wins, and execute the optimal formation against the opposing team’s starting formation. In a typical season, AS Roman finishes close to 4th place in the league. Their average ranking is 3.81 with a standard deviation of 2.5. This means that the team’s average performance falls precisely on the border of championship qualification, which in turn determines whether the team can enjoy the commensurate financial rewards of playing the european championships. Therefore, every slight advantage could determine if AS Roma will continue on to the championships. With this goal in mind, we focused our analysis on how AS Roma can adjust its performance in order to move up in the rankings.

## Approach
Approach was to analyse what are AS Romas Strengths and where they lack. We saw that using the 4-3-3 formation ROMA won most of the matches, hence we choose to keep that formation. Question now was, which players should play in the team and what the skill set should be.
We divided the pitch as below and analyzed the skillset of players on these areas of the pitch. Then using association rules we analyzed what skills along with what part of the pitch they are employed leads to a win.
